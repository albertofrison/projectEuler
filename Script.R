# Problem 1
# Multiples of 3 or 5
# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
# Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
list <- c(1:1000)
sum(list[list %% 3 == 0 | list %% 5 == 0])

# Problem 2
# Even Fibonacci numbers
# Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
# 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
# By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

fibonacci <- c (1,2)
new <- 0

while (new < 4*10^6) {
  penultimate <- fibonacci[length(fibonacci)-1]
  last <- fibonacci[length(fibonacci)]
  new <- penultimate + last
  fibonacci <- c(fibonacci, new)
}
sum (fibonacci[fibonacci %% 2 == 0])

# Problem 3
# Largest Prime Factor
# The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
# What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
